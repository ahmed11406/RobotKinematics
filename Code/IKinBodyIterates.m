%this function: IKinBodyIterates(Blist, M, T, thetalist0, eomg, ev) takes
% the following inputs:
% 1) Blist: the matrix containing the screw axises expressed in the body
% frame as its columns.
% 2) M: the zero-position home configuration of end-effector expressed in
% the space frame.
% 3) T: the desaired end-effector config. expressed in the space frame.
% 4) thetalist0: the initial guess column vector of joint variables.
% 5) eomg and ev: the tolerance in the config. of the resulted end
% effector frame. it's represented as the error of the body twist of the end
% effector. The magnitude of both the omega and v vectors is zero at the
% exact config. desaired.
% the output of each iteration is: the joint variables vector, the config,
% the body twist and the errors in omega and v.
% the final outputs are the solution, the joint vector, and a matrix
% containing all previous iterations joint vectors as its rows and saved as
% a file named iterates.csv at your current MATLAB workplace directory.
